1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

   My current project idea is to develop a distributed peer to peer filesystem
   using the Paxos protocol invented by Leslie Lamport, which is a
   generalisation of the Two Phase Commit protocol and has been used by Google
   and Microsoft in various projects.
   It will use fuse and be written in python using fusepy, a single python
   file that is a wrapper for the fuse shared library. I will use git as a
   VCS.
   Possibilities for extensions involve profiling the hotspots and
   optimising them, either the python code or writing a C extension that
   implements the functionality that needs to be the fastest.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

   Stephen Cross (CC'ed) has agreed to supervise my project.
