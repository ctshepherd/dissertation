\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

\subsection*{Project aims}

I aim to implement a distributed database. This will be based on the Paxos protocol.

\subsubsection*{Paxos}

The first half of the project is to implement the Paxos protocol. This will be done in a module,
providing an interface which the database can then use to 

The project must correctly implement the Paxos protocol.
The library must be capable of forming a running network,
in particular dynamic leader election,
as well as achieving consensus on a key/value store across the network.

\subsubsection*{Database}

The database must implement a subset of SQL, specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A single table with a static name
\item SELECT/INSERT
\item WHERE
\item GROUP BY
\item ORDER BY
\item Aggregation
\end{enumerate}

The database must have all ACID properties, that is:

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}

\section{Motivation}

I set out to build a distributed database based on Paxos. Paxos was first described in Leslie
Lamport's paper \emph{The Part Time Parliament} \cite{lamport98}.

how it integrates with ecosystem (aka what's already out there).


talk about distributed, p2p advantages


\section{Distributed Consensus Problem}


Paxos vs 2PC etc.

\section{Databases}

\subsection{ACID}

Commonly all databases provide ACID properties. ACID stands for:

\begin{itemize}
\item Atomic
\item Consistent
\item Isolated
\item Durable
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Atomic}

Atomicity means that either an operation completes, or it does not, ie, that the database is not
left in a "halfway" state. This means that we do not need to worry about cleaning up after an
operation, if it does not succeed we can simply retry it, without needing to worry about the state
it has left the database in. Atomicity also applies to transactions in the same way - if we have
a transaction as an operation composed of smaller single operations (for example, INCR B, READ A
-> X, WRITE X+10->A), we don't want some of the operations to complete and some not to. In this
example, we may have the constraint A=10*B. If B was incremented but then the transaction failed
before A was updated, we would leave the database in an inconsistent state.

\subsubsection*{Consistent}

Consistency is very closely related to atomicity, as consistency refers to a property of the
database, and atomicity refers to a property of operations performed on the database. In the
example used for atomicity, we had a constraint on the database (that A=B*10). We want operations
(or transactions) to transform the database from one consistent state to another. This becomes
more pertinent in distributed databases, as we may receive operations in one order at one node,
and in a different order at another node. If we apply the operations in the order that we receive
them, the two nodes are likely to be in inconsistent states. XXX: define consistency in a
distributed system.

\subsubsection*{Isolated}

Isolation means 

Why do we want it?

\subsection{Centralisation vs Distributed}

Centralised databases are used in different situations to distributed databases.
C: Easier to perform organise, edit, query, backup. May slow down under load.
easier to maintain integrity of data
D: Can be slow accessing non local data. Need to ensure consistency

centralised: simpler, faster vs distributed: resilient, scalable

\section{Summary of chapters}

\chapter{Preparation}

\section{Paxos}

\subsection{Introduction}

Paxos is a distributed consensus protocol. It was developed by Leslie Lamport at Microsoft
research when he was trying to disprove its existence. Paxos is failure tolerant for up to F
simulatneous failures in a network of 2F+1 nodes.

Paxos is actually a family of protocols, based around the same main algorithm. the Paxos algorithm
is an algorithm for agreeing on a single value across a network of processors. Paxos provides
three guarantees: safety, liveness and non-triviality.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Safety: All nodes eventually agree on the value chosen
	\item Liveness: If a value is proposed, it will eventually be chosen (?? XXX)
	\item Non-triviality: Some value is learnt (this constraint is because the previous two guarantees can
be satisfied without any values being learnt).
\end{enumerate}

Paxos can tolerate certain kinds of failures. These are: messages being delivered late or not at
all, etc XXX.

However Paxos cannot tolerate "rogue" processes, that is, processes deliberately sending malicious
or incorrect messages. There is a variant of Paxos called Byzantine Paxos which can tolerate this,
albeit at a failure tolerance of F for XXX nodes.


\subsection{Definitions}

\subsubsection*{Proposal Numbering}

One of the assumptions that Paxos makes is that every proposal has a unique proposal number. This
is necessary so that proposals have a \emph{total order}, ie we can compare any two proposals to
find the maximum ordered proposal. The conventional way to achieve this is to define a proposal
number as a 2-tuple of (sequence number, node address). These can be compared lexicographically,
and as node addresses are unique, every proposal number will be unique. In practice I plan to use
UUIDs as node identifiers, in order to be confident on uniqueness.

\subsubsection*{Quorums}

Paxos relies on quorums to ensure that 

\subsubsection*{Messages}

Paxos utilises several message types

\subsection{How it works}

\subsection{MultiPaxos}

MultiPaxos is multiple rounds of Paxos occuring at the same time. The way this is outlined in
\emph{Paxos Made Simple} is by a form of leader election. I will outline this here but, for
simplicity, in my project I will simply use multiple Paxos rounds to form the basis of a
distributed operation log. This will be explained in more detail in the Implementation chapter.

\section{ACID}

ACID in more detail


\section{Software Engineering}

\subsection{Module Dependencies}

I chose Twisted in order to make implementing the protocol easier. Twisted provides a lot of
support for implementing protocols and helper classes etc. Also as I am using a state machine
approach to implementing DBP and Paxos, twisted's asynchronous system works very well with this
approach.

\subsection{Programming Language}

There were several options for which programming language to use for this project. C - too
verbose, erlang - too weird, python - just right?

\section{Requirements Analysis}

Requirements for my system:
Transactions
ACID properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item Atomic
\item Consistent
\item Isolated
\item Durable
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software Development Process}

Considered using the waterfall model, but didn't fit my requirements (fast prototyping to
understand Paxos). Decided on spiral because of xyz.

\subsection{Version Control and Backup Strategy}

For version control I decided to use Git, as it is a system I am familiar with, and serves my need
both as a VCS and as a remote backup. In my experience it is more usable than other DVCSs such as
Bazaar, Darcs or Mercurial, and much faster than centralised VCSs such as CVS or SVN. Using Git I
backed up my project both to bitbucket, an online repository service which provides free private
repository hosting, and to my own server.

For backups I use the PWF to develop my project on. As it is stored in Git I can back it up simply
by pushing the repo to other hosts. I currently have it backed up to two other hosts.

\subsection{Testing}

Testing is really important
network
lots of effects
lots of subsystems

\subsubsection{Unit Testing}

unit testing really key
regression testing
testing different subsystems

\subsubsection{Integration Testing}

test program etc
see simple change propagate across complex system

\chapter{Evaluation}

This is where the second most amount of marks are gained.

\section{Testing}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item unit test inertia
	\item test programs, see complex effects of single change.
	\item durable - network - stable storage
