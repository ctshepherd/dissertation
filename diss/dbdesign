3 Components:
Local DB
TX Distribution network
Paxos network

To perform an operation:
- reserve a TX id
- wait for previous TXs to be populated
- sync db up to previous TXs
- perform operation

To distribute an operation:
- reserve a TX id
- distribute TX(commit)

In practice the client does both of these things:
- reserve a TX id
- wait for previous TXs to be populated
- sync db up to previous TXs
- perform operation
- distribute TX(commit)



TX Distribution Protocol Design:

Based on netstrings.
Messages (encapsulated in netstring) are of the form:
<command>(:<contents>) (contents is optional if the command has no other information).

Possible commands:

VERSION:<version number>

Must be first command, informs the other party of the version of the protocol we are operating.
Version number is an integer.

SEND:<tx_id>|<tx_op>

Distribute a TX across the network. tx_id is a TX id that has been reserved by the sending node
for itself. tx_op is a serialization of an operation (this is not properly defined at the moment).

QUIT

End the connection gracefully.



Paxos network:

The Paxos network is used for reserving a TX id for a particular node's use. It is discussed in
more detail in other documents.
