\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

\subsection*{Project aims}

I aim to implement a distributed database. This will be based on the Paxos protocol.

\subsubsection*{Paxos}

The first half of the project is to implement the Paxos protocol. This will be done in a module,
providing an interface which the database can then use to 

The project must correctly implement the Paxos protocol.
The library must be capable of forming a running network,
in particular dynamic leader election,
as well as achieving consensus on a key/value store across the network.

\subsubsection*{Database}

The database must implement a subset of SQL, specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A single table with a static name
\item SELECT/INSERT
\item WHERE
\item GROUP BY
\item ORDER BY
\item Aggregation
\end{enumerate}

The database must have all ACID properties, that is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Atomic
\item Consistent
\item Isolated
\item Durable
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Work Completed}

All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

None.

I, Charlie Shepherd of Churchill College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer Science
Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation does not contain material that
has already been used to any substantial extent for a comparable purpose.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

I set out to build a distributed database based on Paxos. Paxos was first described in Leslie
Lamport's paper \emph{The Part Time Parliament} \cite{lamport98}.

\chapter{Preparation}

\section{Requirements Analysis}

Requirements for my system:
Transcations
ACID properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item Atomic
\item Consistent
\item Isolated
\item Durable
\end{enumerate}


\section{Software Engineering}

\subsection{Version Control}

For version control I decided to use Git, as it is a system I am familiar with, and serves my need
both as a VCS and as a remote backup. In my experience it is more usable than other DVCSs such as
Bazaar, Darcs or Mercurial, and much faster than centralised VCSs such as CVS or SVN. Using Git I
backed up my project both to bitbucket, an online repository service which provides free private
repository hosting, and to my own server.

\subsection{Testing}

Testing is really important
network
lots of effects
lots of subsystems

\subsubsection{Unit Testing}

unit testing really key
regression testing
testing different subsystems

\subsubsection{Integration Testing}

test program etc
see simple change propogate across complex system

%\subsection{Code Style}

%In order to make this

\chapter{Implementation}

This is where most of the marks are gained.



\cleardoublepage
\chapter{Evaluation}

This is where the second most amount of marks are gained.

\section{Testing}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item unit test inertia
	\item test programs, see complex effects of single change.
	\item durable - network - stable storage
\end{enumerate}
